This is a simple voice command application made using Google's speech recognition api. What this does is, it takes your command input after you have executed the assistant.py. If this fails to work, pass the commands(like, "open my facebook", "olympics rio" etc) to the terminal command "python3 query.py". The sample command looks like this : "python3 query.py speak of my fortune".
